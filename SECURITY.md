# Security Policy

This project is meant as a sample, that can also be used as a starting point for your own implementation.
It is meant as _inspiration_ and we advise the reader to use their own judgement and security analysis when using the code herein.

## Main attack vectors

The main types of problems that can occur with this repository:

- **On developer machines**: if you fork and/or clone this repository, install dependencies, and run the sample, you might be vulnerable to problems with (dev) dependencies that are not up to date. Update locally if you want to be more sure of having no issues.
- **For users at runtime**: if you use this repository as a starting point, then _you_ should take care to update dependencies to a point where it protects your users adequately. The ones in this repository might be slightly out of date.

For either scenario, feel free to report a problem you feel should be fixed in the sample repo itself.

## Reporting an issue

To report a (potential) security problem _with the sample_, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jeroenheijmans/sample-angular-oauth2-oidc-with-auth-guards/issues).
Please note that we are not able to give individual projects or spin-offs from this sample.
